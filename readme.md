# VR Interaction Research

*Picking Up a Cube*

*Viviana Jenkins*

## Interaction Description

*I will implement 4 ways to interact with and pick up a cube:*

1. Picking it up using direct hand interaction utilizing raw physics, allowing the user to cup the cube with their hands and balance it, or pick it up by going from under it. This interaction has no methods of friction, so it is designed to show the baseline for hand interaction without assistance in VR.

2. Using hand snapping to allow the user to grab the cube by having the users fingers snap to the edges of the cube, allowing them to easily grip the cube with one hand.

3. Pulling the cube to the users hand by closing the hand while nearby the cube, the cube then flys to the users hand and can then be held as long as the user keeps their hand closed.

4. Using either the users hand or a controller to pick up and manipulate the cube from a distance. The cube will maintain its original distance and angle relative to the users initial hand position and rotation, allowing them to manpulate the cube more freely instead of limiting their range of motion to that of their arms.

## Storyboards

**This diagram is currently slightly out of date with my final interactions, so I will update it soon to better reflect the nature of my final interactions.**

# User Testing Research Questions

## Pre-Test Questions

1. Have you previously used Hand Tracking in VR? What was your experience with that in the past?

2. Do you prefer physical or hand-based interaction or controller-based interaction in VR?

3. Do you prefer interactions in VR to be more immersive and true to life, or more intuitive?

## Post-Test Questions

1. Which interaction felt the most intuitive to you?

2. Which interaction felt the most immersive or engaging to you?

3. Do you prever more precision, better ease-of-use, or more immersion when manipulating the objects? Do you think this depends on the type of application you are using?

### User 1

**Pre-Test Questions**
1. No hand tracking experience
2. In vr, they would prefer controllers.
3. Prefers a more intuitive experience at first, and then more immersive over time. Wants it to ease-in as they learn more about the application.

**Post-Test Questions**
1. The green one felt the most natural.
2. Red one felt the most immersive
3. Ease of use is prefered, since they don't game a lot, more intuitive gives a better experience for them.
