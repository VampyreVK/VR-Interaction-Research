# VR Interaction Research
*Picking Up a Cube*

*Viviana Jenkins*

## Interaction Description

*I will implement 4 ways to interact with and pick up a cube:*
1. Picking it up using physics involving the hand, allowing the user to cup the cube with their hands and balance it while picking it up.
2. Using hand snapping to allow the user to grab the cube by having the users fingers snap to the edges of the cube, allowing them to easily grip the cube with one hand.
3. Pulling the cube to the users hand by closing the hand while nearby the cube, the cube then flys to the users hand and can then be held as long as the user keeps their hand closed.
4. Using either the users hand or a controller to pick up and manipulate the cube from a distance. The cube will maintain its original distance and angle to the users hand, allowing them to manpulate it more openly instead of limiting their range of motion to that of their arms.

## Storyboards
**This diagram is currently slightly out of date with my final interactions, so I will update it soon to better reflect the nature of my final interactions.
